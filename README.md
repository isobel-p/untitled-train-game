# Untitled Train Game
The only thing better than the journey is the adventure.

## Description
A scrappy Pygame project made in about 2 months. You take the role of a train conductor dodging spiders and grabbing passengers.

My first attempt at Pygame, no tutorials used. All open-source.

## Gameplay Instructions
Hold spacebar to accelerate.
Release to decelerate.

Collect passengers, avoid spiders.

You start with three lives (or passengers, interpret how you will). Passengers give you a life. Spiders make you lose a life.

The journey may take multiple days in which the background alternates between day and night.

Very little strategy involved. One button for accessibility. The highest score I have seen is 3042. Most average around 1200.
